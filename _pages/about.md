### Profession
I am studying Information Management at Northeastern University in Seattle from 2017 to 2019. Before, I was a software engineer in Oracle, and then a tech lead in Sony for 9+ years in total.

My prospective profession is to be a data engineer/scientist after graduation in May 2019. So I will show some of my school/side projects on this website, including some technical articles related to `java`, `python`, `web-design`, `database`, `cloud computing`, `big data` and `data science`.

If you would like to know more about my profession, please check [my cv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/binshi/).

### Interests
Mindfulness and productivity are my interests. I am still on my way to practice and build my own methodology.

My other hobbies include reading, travel, and photography. I will keep writing notes and articles (mostly in Chinese) on [my life blog](http://shibin.info).
